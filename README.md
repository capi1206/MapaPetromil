# MapaPetromil
Visualization of Petromil gas stations and its volume
on the html the location of the file eds.csv needs to be changed the file rutas.geojson is too big and could not be loaded
the ipynb file helps transforming  data to make it suitable for the map rendering
run the ExtraerNegociosGoogleAPI.ipynb file to use the google API key and extract the nearby establishments to the gas stations
The file mapa1.png provides a visual exaple of how the routes look, displaying tolls tations and gas stations, the image mapa2.png provides a visualization of nearby comerces to a gas station with a legend on the left explainin the meaning of the icons
As it is displayed in the snapshots of the visualization the bigger the volume of transactions that a gas station receives through historic data the brighter the point staion is displayed in the map.
When clicked on a station there appears a button that upon click displays a graph showing the ratio of nearby businesses, the idea is to get data from these nearb business to be able to desplay deeper analytic tools.
